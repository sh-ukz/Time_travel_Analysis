# Time_travel_Analysis
A traffic data analysis project using Python to evaluate travel time reliability through visualizations and reliability indexes. The study compares route segments such as flyovers and underpasses to identify the most efficient travel options.

## 📌 Objective

To identify patterns in travel time and provide recommendations on the best route (flyover vs underpass) based on traffic conditions.

## 🧪 Methodology

- Collected traffic data from multiple route segments.
- Cleaned and merged Excel sheets using Python.
- Calculated metrics such as:
  - Travel time
  - Traffic delay
  - Reliability indicators
- Visualized trends hour-wise and day-wise.

## 📁 Files

- `Time_Travel_Reliability_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis.
- `data/`: Cleaned Excel files used for analysis are available here:

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- Travel delays vary significantly by time of day and weekday.
- Flyovers are generally more efficient during peak hours.
- Underpasses show consistent delays during certain intervals.
